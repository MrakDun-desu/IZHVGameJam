# Theme: Unconventional Physics

## Ideas for the theme

- cloud
  - player is a cloud in a confined space and tries to finish the level by escaping to the top of the level
  - player can grow when meeting other clouds or shrink when getting near heat sources
  - growing makes player jump higher (or lower since gravity is reversed), but shrinking enables player to squeeze through small spaces
  - game is basically a reverse platformer, where player floats up by themselves and jumps down

## General ideas

- settings
  - sound
- genre
  - puzzle platformer
- platform
  - desktop standalone
- style
  - player is a cloud
  - cloud has to escape to the sky (by floating up)
  - cloud has to beware of heat (it dissolves the cloud)
  - cloud can use rain to influence electricity

## Mechanics

- jumping downwards
- heat sources (shrinking the player)
- wind (makes player float to one side or the other)
- electricity (powering different mechanisms)
- raining - raining down on electric circuit can make it shortcut, raining in between cables makes connection between them and closes the circuit
- buttons (maybe)

## Visuals

- normal blocks - white (glass)
- heat blocks - red
- electricity blocks - yellow
- circuit blocks - green with yellow stripes (green for now)
