# Theme: Unconventional Physics

## Ideas for the theme

- 0G
  - player will stick to platforms and fly through air instead of being pulled down

## General ideas

- settings
  - sound
  - resolution
- genre
  - puzzle platformer
- platform
  - desktop standalone
- style
  - player is a cloud (as the team name implies)
  - getting in contact with water makes player larger, getting in contact with heat smaller
  - there is a time limit (cloud is raining) and places with water are checkpoints
  - player can use parts of their body moisture to attack or to propel themselves, which shortens their time

## Mechanics

- Cloud (player) has a certain amount of time to get to the end of the level
  by propelling themselves by using water in their body
- Player can meet other clouds and merge with them, increasing the time limit
- Player needs to be aware of heat sources, getting close to them takes up
  time and size from the player
- Player is in 0G, therefore only option to propel themselves is using its body
- Some obstacles can be moved or dissolved by raining on them
